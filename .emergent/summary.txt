The AI engineer's work commenced with establishing a full-stack AMT trading bot, featuring a FastAPI backend and React frontend. Key early features included a data simulator, a live Binance data toggle, and subsequent development into an Electron desktop application for Windows. The latest focus shifted to Docker container deployment, involving extensive Dockerfile and  creation. Initial Docker build issues, such as missing  and Node.js version incompatibility, were successfully resolved. The current status reveals that while MongoDB is healthy and the backend is starting, the frontend container remains unhealthy. Detailed logs indicate persistent  and  errors when the frontend's Nginx attempts to connect to the backend service within the Docker network, pointing to a critical inter-container communication or backend initialization problem.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to build an automated trading bot using Fabio Valentini's Auction Market Theory (AMT) for cryptocurrency (LTCUSDT, DOGEUSDT, BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT) on Binance, supporting 1-minute and 5-minute timeframes. It integrates OHLCV, Trade stream, and Order book data. The bot employs a three-step framework: Market State Detection, Location (Volume Profile analysis for POC, VAH/VAL, LVN/HVN), and Aggression Detection (CVD, Big Prints, Footprint Analysis). It generates signals with a confidence score (â‰¥70% threshold) using Trend Continuation and Mean Reversion models. AI integration utilizes the OpenRouter API (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) for continuous per-candle market analysis. The UI features an AI control panel, symbol monitor, dual volume profile visualizations (Current, Full Day) with current price, a signal feed, and order flow metrics. Initial development used a data simulator, which was later enhanced with realistic prices and a toggle for live Binance data. Subsequently, the application was packaged as an Electron desktop app and then containerized using Docker.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug the unhealthy frontend Docker container, specifically addressing  and  errors when Nginx tries to connect to the backend.
- Ensure full end-to-end functionality of the Dockerized application (backend communication, data streaming).
- Fully implement the continuous AI analysis workflow when the AI analysis toggle is enabled.

Currently, the Docker containers build and start.  is healthy.  reports deprecation warnings but seems to be running, though its health status is Starting. The  container is Unhealthy. Logs for  repeatedly show Nginx failing to connect to the backend service (e.g., , ) with  or . This indicates a network connectivity issue or that the backend is not fully ready/reachable within the Docker internal network, preventing the frontend from communicating with it.

The AI engineer successfully built a trading signal bot based on Fabio's Auction Market Theory. Initial development focused on a FastAPI backend and React frontend, incorporating a data simulator. Key challenges included severe Binance API geo-restrictions, leading to a pivot towards a robust demo mode with a toggle for future live deployment. Frontend charting with  proved highly problematic, requiring multiple fixes for API usage, lifecycle management, visual issues, and data handling. Backend development involved resolving recurring Python  due to malformed docstrings and enhancing data generation/aggregation. The AI demonstrated adaptability, systematically debugging numerous issues across both stacks. User feedback iteratively guided refinements, including reverting complex charting to simplified dual volume profiles (Current and Full Day) and finally initiating the setup for an installable Electron desktop application.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to develop an automated trading signal bot using Fabio Valentini's Auction Market Theory (AMT) for cryptocurrency trading on Binance (LTCUSDT, DOGEUSDT, BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT) across 1-minute and 5-minute timeframes. It integrates OHLCV, Trade stream, and Order book data. The bot follows a three-step framework: Market State Detection (Balance/Imbalance), Location (Volume Profile analysis for POC, VAH/VAL, LVN/HVN), and Aggression Detection (CVD, Big Prints, Footprint Analysis). Two trading models, Trend Continuation and Mean Reversion, generate signals with a calculated confidence score (â‰¥70% threshold). AI integration uses OpenRouter API (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) for comprehensive and continuous per-candle market analysis. The UI features an AI control panel, symbol monitor, dual volume profile visualizations (Current, Full Day) with current price, a signal feed, and order flow metrics. Initially, a data simulator was used, which was enhanced with realistic prices and a toggle for live Binance data. The latest request is to make the application installable as an Electron desktop app.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The central FastAPI application handling API endpoints, WebSocket, data streaming (simulated/live Binance), data processing (OHLCV, Volume Profile, Order Flow), and AI integration.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup with a basic simulator. Expanded to include  and  classes for real-time/simulated data. Numerous fixes for  due to escaped newline characters. Added ,  endpoints. Volume profile calculation was refined to generate Current and Full Day profiles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing application state, data fetching, routing, and overall UI composition.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented initial UI with WARMING UP and configuration screens. Integrated  components. Added a data mode toggle in the header for switching between demo and live data. Managed historical data fetching and AI analysis state.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Dedicated component for visualizing volume profiles (Point of Control, Value Area High/Low, Low/High Volume Nodes).
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced to include a line indicating the current price. Modified to be compact for displaying two profiles (Current and Full Day) side-by-side, with adjusted sizes for key levels.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Electron's main process entry point, responsible for app lifecycle, window creation, and backend integration.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to initialize the Electron application.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A script that runs before the renderer process loads, providing a secure bridge to Node.js APIs.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created for the Electron setup.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js dependencies specific to the Electron environment.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created with  and  dependencies installed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A markdown file intended to provide instructions for building and packaging the Electron application.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to house future build steps.

<pending_tasks>
- Provide detailed instructions for building and packaging the Electron desktop application.
- Integrate the FastAPI backend and React frontend within the Electron application environment.
- Fully implement the continuous AI analysis workflow when the AI analysis toggle is enabled.

<current_work>
The immediate work being done is the initiation of the Electron desktop application setup. Following the user's request to make the application installable, the AI engineer has created the foundational structure for an Electron wrapper. This involved:
1.  **Creating the  directory**: This will house all Electron-specific files.
2.  **Generating **: This file is the main script for the Electron process, responsible for launching the application window.
3.  **Generating **: This script runs in the renderer process before web content loads, providing a secure context bridge.
4.  **Generating **: This file defines Electron-specific dependencies like  and , which were then installed.
5.  **Creating **: This file is an empty placeholder, intended to contain the build instructions for the Electron application.

At this point, the basic Electron project structure is in place, and the next logical step is to populate the  with the necessary steps to compile and package the application. The application currently functions as a web app with dual volume profiles and a demo/live data toggle.

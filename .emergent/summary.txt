The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an AMT trading bot. Initially, the focus was on establishing a FastAPI backend and React frontend, evolving from a data simulator to include a demo/live data toggle due to Binance API restrictions. After addressing numerous UI and backend issues, the user requested an installable Electron desktop application for Windows. The AI successfully set up the basic Electron structure, including configuration files and build scripts. Subsequently, the user pivoted to a Docker container deployment. This involved extensive Dockerfile creation,  setup, and resolving critical build issues like missing  and Node.js version incompatibility through iterative debugging and user guidance. The Docker containers now build successfully, but the frontend container is currently unhealthy, requiring further investigation.

The project aims to develop an automated trading signal bot using Fabio Valentini's Auction Market Theory (AMT) for cryptocurrency trading on Binance (LTCUSDT, DOGEUSDT, BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT) across 1-minute and 5-minute timeframes. It integrates OHLCV, Trade stream, and Order book data. The bot follows a three-step framework: Market State Detection (Balance/Imbalance), Location (Volume Profile analysis for POC, VAH/VAL, LVN/HVN), and Aggression Detection (CVD, Big Prints, Footprint Analysis). Two trading models, Trend Continuation and Mean Reversion, generate signals with a calculated confidence score (â‰¥70% threshold). AI integration uses OpenRouter API (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) for comprehensive and continuous per-candle market analysis. The UI features an AI control panel, symbol monitor, dual volume profile visualizations (Current, Full Day) with current price, a signal feed, and order flow metrics. Initially, a data simulator was used, which was enhanced with realistic prices and a toggle for live Binance data. The latest requests included making the application installable as an Electron desktop app and then deploying it via Docker containers.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved setting up the Docker container deployment for the AMT Trading Bot. This included creating s for both the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React with Nginx), a  file to orchestrate these services along with a MongoDB instance, and various supporting configuration files like  and . Environment files () and comprehensive documentation (, updated , ) were also created.

During the Docker build process, several issues were encountered:
1.  **Missing **: The frontend Dockerfile initially failed because  was not present in the frontend directory. This was resolved by instructing the user to run yarn install v1.22.22

[2/4] Fetching packages...

success Saved lockfile.
Done in 0.09s. locally in the frontend directory and by modifying the Dockerfile to use .
2.  **Node.js Version Incompatibility**: The  package required Node.js version 20+, but the  initially specified . This led to repeated build failures. The AI engineer updated the  to  and provided explicit instructions to the user to update their local Dockerfile and use  to force a rebuild without cached layers.

After resolving these issues, the Docker containers successfully built and started. The current status, as reported by , is:
*   : Healthy
*   : Starting (should become healthy soon)
*   : Unhealthy

The AI engineer is now at the stage of diagnosing why the  container is unhealthy, which is critical for ensuring the application is fully functional in the Dockerized environment.
